{"name":"Atk","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/atk","body":"This directory contains the ATK library.\r\n\r\nFor more information about ATK and accessibility in GNOME, see:\r\n http://projects.gnome.org/accessibility\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\nATK requires GLib-2.0.0 or better. Information about GLib\r\nis available from http://www.gtk.org/.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nTo configure ATK, run the ./configure script, then 'make'; and \r\n'make install'. If you are installing into a location where you don't have\r\nwrite permission, you'll have to become root before running \r\n'make install'.\r\n\r\nGeneral information about building ATK and related libraries can\r\nbe found at:\r\n\r\n  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-building.html\r\n\r\nTo compile a CVS version of atk on your system, you will need to take\r\nseveral steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these\r\nsteps at once by running:\r\n\r\n        cvsroot/atk# ./autogen.sh\r\n  \r\nBasically this does the following for you:\r\n\r\n        cvsroot/atk# aclocal; automake; autoconf\r\n\r\n        The above commands create the \"configure\" script.  Now you\r\n        can run the configure script in cvsroot/atk to create all\r\n        the Makefiles.\r\n\r\nBefore running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool\r\nin your path.\r\n\r\nNote that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass\r\noptions like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options\r\nto autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs\r\n==================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.\r\n(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product atk.) You will need to create an\r\naccount for yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can also mail the mailing list gnome-accessibility-devel@gnome.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
