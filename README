Dependencies
============

In order to get CVS atk installed on your system, you need to have
the most recent CVS version of glib installed as well.

Building
========

To compile a CVS version of atk on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

        cvsroot/atk# ./autogen.sh
  
Basically this does the following for you:

        cvsroot/atk# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/atk to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.
